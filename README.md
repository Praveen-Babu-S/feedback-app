This is a simple progressive application developed by me when I'm learning React Js. This is a simple feedback app.
It can be integrate with any application which requires customers ratings and reviews about services purchased. It displays the total noof reviews and average rating.
 I have used motion framer package for animation, material-ui icon, css for styling, React-Router V6 and Context API to manage global state.
